**Updates:**

- **New Github Repo!** Vice is responsible for this repo which you should redirect questions to him regarding this.
- Every update a date will be included; this is to easily track each **update**.
- Only **minor updates** would be frequenctly updated here - major updates will be announced in discord so dw you lazy bitches
- yes i fucking know i wrote the date as x\x\x instead of x/x/x, thats due to github being ass with dates.

# I will be looking forward to the potential of this modpack! Further minor updates will be having new repos in the /main/Update-Tracker page and an interrogration will be announcing everything in discord! ^_^
